              identifying the location of gene regulatory elements, including

              Although Southern blots are the traditional method of identifying
              DNase I hypersensitive sites, the conventional manual method is
              not readily scalable to studying large chromosomal regions, much

              that can rapidly identify DNase I hypersensitive sites for any
              region of interest, or potentially for the entire genome, by
              using tiled microarrays. We used DNase-chip to identify DNase I
              hypersensitive sites accurately from a representative 1\% of the
              human genome in both primary and immortalized cell types. We
              found that although most DNase I hypersensitive sites were
              present in both cell types studied, some of them were cell-type
              specific. This method can be applied globally or in a targeted
              fashion to any tissue from any species with a sequenced genome.",

  abstract = "A major goal in genomics is to understand how genes are regulated
              in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and
              species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear
              chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of
              identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in
              the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have
              recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library
              of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis,
              using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000
              tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T
              cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified
              14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to
              each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that
              the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites.
              Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within
              one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain
              regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes,
              CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites
              identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells,
              hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and
              HeLa cells. However, approximately 10\% of the DNase HS sites are
              lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify
              gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This
              strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will
              enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates
              cell function and fate.",

              coincides with open or accessible genomic sites of remodeled

              separate the genome by enzymatic or chemical means and isolate
              either the accessible or protected locations. The isolated DNA is
              then quantified using a next-generation sequencing platform. Wide
